## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
actcsv <- unzip("./activity.zip")
act <- read.csv(actcsv)
byday <- factor(act, unique(act$date), exclude = NA)
byinterval <-factor(act, unique(act$interval), exclude = NA)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
stepsperday <- tapply(act$steps, act$date, sum, na.rm = T)
hist(stepsperday, main = "Steps per day", xlab = "Steps", ylab = "Number of Days", col = "Red", breaks = 15)
```

The mean number of steps per day is: `mean(stepsperday)`
The median number of steps per day is: `median(stepsperday)`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
intstepsmean <- tapply(act$steps, act$interval, mean, na.rm = T)
ism <- as.numeric(intstepsmean)
int <- as.numeric(levels(byinterval))
plot(int, ism, type = 'l', main = "Steps throughout day", xlab = "Time Interval", ylab = "Mean Steps")
```

The interval with the most steps on average is: `int[[which.max(ism)]]` - `int[[which.max(ism) + 1]]`


## Imputing missing values

The total number of rows with missing values is: `sum(!complete.cases(act))`

```{r}
pos <- which(is.na(act), arr.ind = T)
ind <- match(act[pos, 3], int)
act1 <- act
act1[pos, 1] <- ism[ind]
```

```{r}
stepsperday1 <- tapply(act1$steps, act1$date, sum, na.rm = T)
hist(stepsperday1, main = "Adjusted steps per day", xlab = "Steps", ylab = "Number of Days", col = "Red", breaks = 15)
```

The mean number of steps per day is: `mean(stepsperday1)`
The median number of steps per day is: `median(stepsperday1)`

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
